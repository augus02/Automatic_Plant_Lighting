# Automatic plant lighting
Most of us have plants at home. Whether they have an aromatic or decorative purpose, they renew our link with nature, especially if we live in an apartment. But plants are fragile and sensitive to their environment, mainly water supply and lighting. Watering the plants is easy, whereas the lighting is more difficult to control. We either rely on natural lighting, which can sometimes not be enough for the good development of the plant, or we can use artificial lighting that provides the right wavelengths absorbed by the plant. The goal of this project is to merge both of these lighting solutions to create an automatically adapting lighting depending on the cloud coverage of the geographic zone.
